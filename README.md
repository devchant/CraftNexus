# Payments Architecture & Trust Model

CraftNexus uses the Stellar network strictly for **payments, settlement, and value transfer**, ensuring speed, transparency, and financial inclusion without introducing unnecessary blockchain complexity.

## Stablecoin Strategy

* **USDC on Stellar** is the primary transaction currency across the platform.
* Prices are displayed in local currency equivalents for user clarity, while settlement occurs in USDC.
* This provides:

  * Price stability for artisans
  * Predictable earnings
  * Protection against local currency volatility
* **XLM** is used only for network fees and is abstracted from end users.

CraftNexus does **not** introduce a native token.

---

## Wallet & Account Model

* Each artisan is provisioned with a **non-custodial Stellar wallet** at onboarding.
* Wallet creation and signing are abstracted through a simplified UX to support non-technical users.
* Users retain full ownership of their funds at all times.

This model removes the need for:

* Traditional bank accounts
* International wire transfers
* Third-party payout intermediaries

---

## Anchor & Cash-Out Strategy

CraftNexus integrates with **existing Stellar anchors** to enable fiat on-ramps and off-ramps.

### Initial Focus Regions

* Africa
* Latin America
* Southeast Asia

Artisans can:

* Hold USDC digitally
* Convert to local fiat via supported anchors
* Use USDC for other Stellar-based services

Anchor selection prioritizes:

* Regulatory compliance
* Regional availability
* Low conversion fees

---

## Payment Flow

1. Buyer initiates purchase (product or course)
2. USDC payment is sent on Stellar
3. Transaction settles in ~5 seconds
4. Artisan receives funds instantly in their wallet
5. Platform commission is automatically deducted

All transactions are:

* Transparent
* Auditable
* Final upon settlement

---

## Escrow & Delivery Protection

CraftNexus implements an **escrow-style payment release model** for physical goods to protect both buyers and artisans.

### Digital Goods & Courses

* Funds are released immediately upon successful payment
* Course access is unlocked instantly

### Physical Products

* Payment is held temporarily at the platform level
* Funds are released when:

  * Delivery is confirmed by the buyer, or
  * A predefined delivery window elapses without dispute

This approach balances:

* Buyer trust
* Artisan cash-flow reliability
* Operational simplicity for the MVP

**✅ IMPLEMENTED**: CraftNexus uses **Soroban Smart Contracts** for fully on-chain escrow functionality. All escrow operations are executed on the Stellar blockchain, providing transparency and security without intermediaries.

---


## Technical Philosophy

CraftNexus follows a **utility-first blockchain design**:

* Blockchain is used only where it provides clear user value
* No speculative mechanics
* No financial abstraction layers
* No unnecessary tokenization

The goal is to make blockchain **invisible to users**, while delivering its benefits transparently.

---

## Impact Alignment

CraftNexus directly advances:

* Financial inclusion
* Global creator monetization
* Stablecoin adoption for real commerce
* Economic empowerment in emerging markets

By lowering payment friction and eliminating banking barriers, CraftNexus enables artisans to **own their income, reach global buyers, and scale sustainably**.

---
